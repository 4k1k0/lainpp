#Lainpp

##What is Lainpp?
Lainpp is a browser extension for [Lainchan](https://lainchan.org). It *"works"* in Chromium/Chrome and Firefox.

##Why Lainpp?
Because I am a C++ nerd.

##Does it work?
Barely. It has a lot of bugs but you can help if you want.

##Why a browser extension and not a contribution to Lainchan's Github repo?
Because I didn't want to install all the dependencies just to test a few lines of Javascript and CSS.

##The icon is *super* ugly
I know but I'm not sure if I'm able to use the Lainchan's favicon for this, ~~but I use that icon on my computer and it looks cute.~~

##TODO
- Fix the lightbox, when you load an image for the first time it doesn't use the margin.
- When you use the *Expand everything* button it also loads the videos.
